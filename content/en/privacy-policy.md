Hey there! 👋 This Privacy Policy breaks down how we collect, use, and spill the beans (or not!) on your info when you're using our service. Plus, it's gonna tell you all about your privacy rights and how the law's got your back.

So, what's the deal with your personal data? We use it to get our service running smoothly and make it even better for you. By jumping in and using our service, you're basically saying, "Yep, I'm cool with you collecting and using my info according to this Privacy Policy." Easy peasy!

## Interpretations and Definitions

### Interpretations
Alright, so let's get our terms straight! Words that start with a capital letter have special meanings defined below. And hey, these definitions stay the same whether they're singular or plural, just so you know! 😉

### Definitions
For the lowdown on this Privacy Policy, here's what we mean by:

-   **Account** refers to a unique account set up just for you to get into our service, or specific parts of it.

-   **Affiliate** means an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another party. "Control" here means holding 50% or more of the shares, equity interest, or other voting securities needed to elect directors or other managing bodies.

-   **Company** (when we say "the Company," "We," "Us," or "Our" in this document) means **hubtoday**.

-   **Device** means pretty much anything you can use to hop onto our service—think computers, cellphones, or even your trusty digital tablet.

-   **Personal Data** is any info that's connected to an identified or identifiable individual.

-   **Service** means, well, this website!

-   **Service Provider** means any natural or legal person crunching data on behalf of the Company. Think of them as third-party companies or individuals we've hired to help run the service, provide services for us, or even just help us figure out how folks are using it. They're like our trusty sidekicks!

-   **Usage Data** is that data collected automatically, usually generated from you using the service or from the service's own infrastructure (like how long you chill on a certain page).

-   **Website** means **hubtoday**, which you can find chilling at `https://ai.hubtoday.app/`.

-   **You** means the awesome individual checking out or using our service, or if you're representing them, the company or legal entity doing the accessing. That's you!

## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data Collected

#### Personal Data
When you're hanging out on our service, we might ask you for some personally identifiable info. This helps us get in touch or figure out who you are. This kind of info could include, but isn't limited to:

-   Email address 📧
-   Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Here's the scoop on Usage Data: it's automatically gathered whenever you're using our service.

This data might include cool stuff like your device's Internet Protocol address (aka that trusty IP address), your browser type and version, which pages you're checking out on our service, the exact time and date of your visit, how long you're hanging around on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

If you're accessing the service via your mobile device, we might automatically collect some info there too. This includes (but isn't limited to!) the type of mobile device you're rocking, its unique ID, your mobile IP address, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile internet browser you're using, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

Oh, and whenever you visit our service—whether on desktop or mobile—we might also grab the info your browser sends our way.

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies
So, how do we keep tabs on what's happening and remember your preferences? We use Cookies and other neat tracking tech to watch activity on our service and stash away certain info. These tracking goodies include things like beacons, tags, and scripts – all used to collect data, keep track of stuff, and ultimately make our service better and analyze how it's being used. Some of the tech we use might be:

-   **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: Basically, a Cookie is just a tiny file popped onto your device. You can totally tell your browser to reject all Cookies or give you a heads-up when one's being sent. But, heads-up: if you don't accept Cookies, some parts of our service might not work quite right for you. Unless you've specifically told your browser to block 'em, our service will likely be using Cookies.

-   **Web Beacons**: You might find these small electronic files, also called clear gifs, pixel tags, or single-pixel gifs, lurking in some parts of our service and our emails. They're super handy for us to count users who've visited certain pages or opened an email, and for other cool website stats (like checking out how popular a section is or making sure our systems are shipshape).

Just so you know, Cookies come in two flavors: "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. Persistent Cookies stick around on your computer or phone even after you've logged off, while Session Cookies vanish the moment you close your web browser. Poof! 💨

We actually use both Session and Persistent Cookies for these reasons:

-   **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
    -   **Type**: Session Cookies
    -   **Administered by**: Us
    -   **Purpose**: These Cookies are absolutely crucial for getting our website services to you and letting you use some of its key features. They're like the bouncers at a club, helping us verify who you are and keeping those pesky fraudulent account uses at bay. Without these bad boys, the services you're asking for just wouldn't be possible, and trust us, we only use them to make sure you get what you came for.

-   **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
    -   **Type**: Persistent Cookies
    -   **Administered by**: Us
    -   **Purpose**: These Cookies are like our little reminders to see if you've already given us the thumbs-up to use cookies on the website. No need to ask twice! 👍

-   **Functionality Cookies**
    -   **Type**: Persistent Cookies
    -   **Administered by**: Us
    -   **Purpose**: These Cookies are the smart ones! They help us remember your choices when you're cruising around our website, like saving your login deets or your preferred language. The whole point here is to give you a super personalized experience and save you the hassle of typing in your preferences every single time you visit. Sweet!

Wanna know more about the Cookies we use and what your options are? Just hop over to our Cookies Policy or check out the Cookies section right here in our Privacy Policy.

### Use of Your Personal Data
Alright, so the Company might use your Personal Data for these specific reasons:

-   **To provide and maintain our Service**: This includes keeping an eye on how our service is being used, making sure everything's running smoothly.
-   **To manage Your Account**: We'll handle your registration as a user of the service. The Personal Data you hand over gives you access to all the different features available to registered users.
-   **For the performance of a contract**: This means working on, sticking to, and delivering on the purchase contract for any products, items, or services you've bought, or any other contract you've made with us through the service.
-   **To contact You**: We might reach out to you via email, phone calls, SMS, or other electronic communication forms (like push notifications from our mobile app). This is for updates or info messages related to features, products, or contracted services, including security updates, whenever it's necessary or makes sense.
-   **To provide You with news and offers**: We'll send you news, special offers, and general info about other goods, services, and events we're slinging that are similar to what you've already bought or asked about. Of course, this is unless you've opted out of getting such info.
-   **To manage Your requests**: We'll process and handle all your requests to us.
-   **For business transfers**: We might use your info to check out or go through with a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or any other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets. This could be as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceedings, where the Personal Data we hold about our service users is among the assets being transferred.
-   **For other purposes**: We might totally use your info for other stuff too, like data analysis, spotting usage trends, figuring out how effective our promo campaigns are, and evaluating and improving our service, products, marketing, and your overall experience.

Now, about sharing your personal info—we might do that in these scenarios:

-   **With Service Providers**: We might share your personal info with our Service Providers to monitor and analyze how our service is used, and to get in touch with you.
-   **For Business Transfers**: If we're looking at a merger, selling off company assets, financing, or acquiring all or part of our business by another company, we might share or transfer your personal info during those negotiations or the actual process. It's all part of the business dance!
-   **With Affiliates**: We could share your info with our affiliates. Don't worry, we'll make sure they play by the rules of this Privacy Policy too. Our affiliates include our parent company, any subsidiaries, joint venture partners, or other companies we control or are under common control with.
-   **With Business Partners**: We might share your info with our business partners to hook you up with specific products, services, or awesome promotions.
-   **With Other Users**: If you spill your personal info or interact with other users in public areas, well, that info might be seen by everyone and could even be publicly distributed outside the service. Just a heads-up! 📢
-   **With Your Consent**: If you give us the green light, we might dish out your personal info for any other purpose you agree to.

### Retention of Your Personal Data
So, how long do we keep your Personal Data? 🕰️ The Company will only hold onto it for as long as it's absolutely necessary for the reasons we've spelled out in this Privacy Policy. We'll also keep and use your Personal Data as much as we need to meet our legal obligations (like if we have to hold your data to follow the law), iron out any disagreements, and make sure our legal agreements and policies are upheld.

The Company will also hold onto Usage Data for our internal analysis. Usually, Usage Data chills with us for a shorter time, unless we need it to seriously beef up the security or supercharge the functionality of our service, or if the law tells us we gotta keep it for longer.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Okay, so your info (including your Personal Data!) gets processed at the Company's main offices and wherever else our processing partners are chilling. This means your data might actually get zipped over to and stored on computers outside your home state, province, country, or whatever government area you're in. Why does that matter? Well, data protection laws in those spots might be different from yours.

By giving this Privacy Policy a nod and sending us your info, you're essentially giving us the green light for that transfer. 🚦

The Company is gonna take all the reasonable and necessary steps to make sure your data is handled safely and in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't ever transfer your Personal Data to an organization or country unless there are seriously awesome controls in place, especially for the security of your data and other personal info. No sketchy business here!

### Delete Your Personal Data
Guess what? You've got the power to delete your Personal Data, or at least ask us for a hand in deleting the stuff we've collected about you! 💥

Our service might even let you zap certain info about yourself right from within the service itself. How cool is that?

You can totally update, tweak, or delete your info anytime by logging into your account (if you've got one, of course!) and heading over to the account settings where you can manage all your personal deets. Or, hey, just hit us up directly to ask for access, corrections, or to delete any personal info you've given us.

But, just a little heads-up: sometimes we might need to hang onto certain info if we've got a legal obligation or a legit reason to do so. Just keeping it real!

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
Heads up! If the Company ever gets into a merger, acquisition, or an asset sale, your Personal Data might be on the move. We'll definitely give you a shout before your Personal Data is transferred and falls under a different Privacy Policy. Just keeping you in the loop!

#### Law Enforcement
Sometimes, things get a bit official. Under certain circumstances, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if the law demands it or if public authorities (like a court or government agency) hit us with a valid request. We gotta play by the rules! 👮‍♀️

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might also feel it's necessary (and we'll truly believe it's for the best) to disclose your Personal Data to:
-   Follow a legal obligation.
-   Protect and defend the Company's rights or property.
-   Stop or investigate potential wrongdoing connected with the service.
-   Keep users of the service or the public safe.
-   Guard against legal liability.

### Security of Your Personal Data
Look, keeping your Personal Data safe and sound is super important to us! 🔐 But let's be real: no method of sending stuff over the internet or storing it electronically is ever 100% foolproof. While we totally bust our chops to use commercially accepted ways to protect your Personal Data, we just can't promise it's absolutely, positively, 100% secure. We're doing our best, though!

## Children's Privacy
Our service isn't aimed at anyone under 13, period. We're super careful not to knowingly collect any personally identifiable info from kids under that age. If you're a parent or guardian and you find out your little one has given us Personal Data, please, please get in touch with us! 🙏 If we ever discover we've accidentally scooped up Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verified parental consent, we'll spring into action and delete that info from our servers. Pronto!

And hey, if we need to get consent as a legal reason for processing your info, and your country says a parent's consent is a must-have, then we might ask for your parent's permission before we collect and use that info. Just making sure everyone's on board!

## Links to Other Websites
Our service might have links leading to other websites that aren't run by us. Just a heads-up! If you click on one of those third-party links, you'll be whisked away to *their* site. We really, really, *really* recommend you take a peek at the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit. Better safe than sorry!

We don't have any say over, and can't take responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. So, browse wisely! 🤓

## Changes to this Privacy Policy
Things change, right? So, we might update our Privacy Policy every now and then. When we do, we'll let you know about any tweaks by just posting the spanking new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before any big changes actually kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a super noticeable announcement on our service. And, of course, we'll update that "Last Updated" date right at the top of this Privacy Policy.

We totally recommend you check back on this Privacy Policy regularly to catch any changes. Any updates to this Privacy Policy become effective the moment they're posted on this page. Easy peasy!
