*Effective: June 1, 2025*

---

👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday**! Before you dive into our awesome services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service. By visiting or using **ai.hubtoday**, you're basically saying "I agree!"

## 1. About Our Services
Our services at **ai.hubtoday** hook you up with paid subscription content and member perks, like blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community vibes. Heads up: some content is only for our subscribed users!

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
*   To snag an account, **users** just need to give us a valid email and set up a password.
*   **Users**, you're totally on the hook for your account's security and anything that happens with it. Sharing or transferring your account? Big no-no! 🙅‍♀️
*   **ai.hubtoday** can, and will, suspend or terminate accounts if users breach these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   Our subscription services are billed monthly or annually, with all costs clearly shown on the checkout page.
*   Payments? They're all handled through third-party platforms like Stripe or PayPal. **ai.hubtoday** won't ever stash your payment info.
*   Your subscription will totally auto-renew unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends.
*   **Our 14-day Refund Policy** is pretty sweet: First-time subscribers, if you're not vibing with our service within 14 days of purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just hit us up at the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why. Heads up, though: it's a one-time deal per user. After 14 days or for repeat subscribers, all payments are final – unless the law says otherwise, of course.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
*   All original content? That's **ai.hubtoday**'s baby! Please don't copy, repost, or use it for commercial stuff without getting our OK first.
*   **Users** only get a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access our content for personal learning and reading.
*   For commercial use or if you want to quote a lot, hit us up at **ai.hubtoday** for authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   As for user conduct, **please don't** upload, post, or spread any illegal, harassing, fake, offensive, or rights-infringing content. Seriously, don't. 🚫
*   Using tech tricks to bulk download, scrape, or crack member content? **Also a no-go!**
*   **ai.hubtoday** can totally remove inappropriate content and ban users who play dirty.

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   **We** totally reserve the right to change, suspend, or ditch parts or all of our services anytime, without notice.
*   In case of force majeure, server glitches, or third-party service outages making content temporarily unavailable, **ai.hubtoday** won't be on the hook for compensation.

## 7. Disclaimer
*   The info provided on **ai.hubtoday** is just for kicks and reference. It's totally not professional advice (like financial, legal, medical, you get the drill 😉).
*   For any direct or indirect losses users might get from using our content or services, **ai.hubtoday** is absolutely not liable. Just sayin'.

## 8. Governing Law
*   These Terms of Service? They're governed by the laws of California, USA, and interpreted that way, no matter what other legal stuff might pop up.
*   Any disputes arising from or related to these terms, **we** should try to chat it out first, amicably. If that doesn't work, you agree to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California, which totally have jurisdiction.
